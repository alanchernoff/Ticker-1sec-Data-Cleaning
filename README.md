# Volatlity Estimation

File 1: Data Cleaning for 1 second stock ticker data
<br/> File 2: Calculates integrated volatility using 1 second interval
<br/> &emsp; converts 1 second ticker data to 1 min, 5 min, and 2.5min intervals
<br/> File 3: Performs ASJ Jump tests from cleaned data and converts to a table
<br/> File 4: Simulates the Monte Carlo data for modelling
<br/> &emsp; used to create the OLS & LASSO models in File 4
<br/> File 5: Simulates the Monte Carlo data used for the table creation in File 5
<br/> File 6: Creates table assessing Monte Carlo data
<br/> File 7: Creates a table with Sharp Ratios
<br/>  &emsp; calculates the volatility measures (realized measures & combination measures)
<br/>  &emsp; calculates the Sharp ratio of using a 5-20 MA cross (signalled by volatility) trading strategy
<br/> File 8: Creates plots of Stock Closing Price vs Estimated Volatility
<br/> File 9: Creates plots of ASJ test statistics
